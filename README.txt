Adds a new field type to Formidable Forms allowing the user to choose a post, page or CPT

== Description ==

Adds a new field type to Formidable Forms allowing the user to choose a post, page or CPT from a dropdown

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Formidable Forms Posts, Pages and CPT Field Type” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Screenshots ==
